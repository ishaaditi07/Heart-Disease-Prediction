This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the severity of heart disease in patients. It uses Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to provide accurate predictions based on patient data. The system handles class imbalance with SMOTE and detects anomalies using One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest to ensure reliable results.

The frontend is built with HTML and CSS, allowing users to manually input patient information such as age, sex, cholesterol, and heart rate. Upon submission, the system processes the data and provides real-time predictions along with visualizations like charts and graphs to help interpret the results.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, HTML, CSS
